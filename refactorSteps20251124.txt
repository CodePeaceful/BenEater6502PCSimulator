hardware needs 2 low and 2 high cycles per clock cycle so any configuration works
    timing notes:
        - CPU DONE
            - address MLB R/W SYNC VPB
                is set during low 1 so execution order does not matter in default configuration
                and garanteed until the end of high 2
            - data will be read during high 2
            - data will be written at high 1 but heald until the end of high 2
            - SOB ?? low 2 to high 1
            - IRQB NMIB RDY RESB will be checked during high 2
            - BE effects in next subcycle

        - VersatileInterfaceAdapter DONE
            - all controll pins are checked at high 1
            - peripherals are checked and buffered at low 2
            - after write peripherals will be set at next low 2
            as timing will stay simplified
            - data will be read during high 2
            - data will be written at high 1 but heald until the end of high 2
            other timings to be determined at implementation of feature

        - RAM DONE
            to keep it working
            - after controlls are set
                - 2 subcycles data will be read
                - 1 subcycle data will be written and kept for 1 extra subcycle after controlls are changed

        - ROM DONE
            to keep it working
            - after controlls are set
                - 1 subcycle data will be written and kept for 1 extra subcycle after controlls are changed

        - Screen DONE
            all timings are milliseconds independent of clock

cpu class is bloated and untestable, needs functions to be extracted
    -ALU extracted
